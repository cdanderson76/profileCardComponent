<h2>What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?</h2>
I'm most proud that the design turned out the way that it did. I was able to get the 'svg' files to work accordingly and created the resulting background.  I didn't have a lot of experience using the 'background-position' property to produce  UIs such as these, but it was nice to gain some familiarity using this property.<\>

I'm not sure that I would do things any different.  I used a 'mobile-first' approach, and I had converted most pixel units into REM units to aid in responsiveness, maintainability, and simplifying global size adjustments.

<h2>What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?</h2>
The one challenge that I'd say that I ran into outside of working with the 'svg' files, was using the transitions for when the screen expands and shrinks.  I think that I could have made them smoother, but that had caused unwanted issues when the 
app mounted.  I opted for the transition that I originally planned, and I went with that as a small addition to this application.
