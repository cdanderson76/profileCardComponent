<h2>What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?</h2>
I'm most proud of the design. I was actually able to get the 'svg' files to work accordingly to get the resulting background.  I'm not used to using the 'background-position' property to make UIs like these happen, but it was nice
to get some familiarity of working with it.

I'm not sure that I would do things any different.  I used a 'mobile-first' approach, and I was converted most pixel units into REM units to aid in responsiveness, maintainability, and simplifying global size adjustments.

What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?
The one challenge that I'd say that I ran into was making the project responsive. I just had to keep in mind that I just need to make things presentable, and not necessarily 'pixel perfect'. This allowed me to use my margins and padding more effectively, and I allowed the containers that I worked within to expand and shrink as I see fit, rather than putting a static measurement on them.
